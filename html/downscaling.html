            Reanalyses capture only the large-scale, but some variables vary strongly on much smaller scales.
            This small-scale variation depends on topography or land cover (e.g., near coast lines), for instance.
            Reanalysis data therefore often require spatial refinement. The same is true for weather forecasts,
            or for climate scenarios. The corresponding approaches are called “downscaling”.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            Two classes of approaches are distinguished: numerical and statistical downscaling.
            The former requires a global model or reanalysis, into which a regional numerical weather prediction model
            is embedded. This nesting can be repeated to obtain local information. The regional model adds
            information on topography and land cover, while meteorological information is passed on from large to
            small scales. Weather forecasts are done in that way. Statistical downscaling uses statistical
            relations between the large-scale predictors (e.g., from a reanalysis) and local weather variables from observations.

        <p class="card-text">
            An intuitive statistical method is analog downscaling, which assumes that similar
            large-scale conditions lead to similar local weather. If a sufficiently large set of
            conditions is available for both, large-scale variables and local weather, then local weather can be estimated
            for a given large-scale situation by choosing the most similar case. You can train this approach in the <span class="text-danger">exercise</span>.

            Local precipitation is difficult to forecast, whereas forecasts for large-scale conditions are reliable.
            Given a sufficiently large pool of potential analog days, i.e.,
            with data for local precipitation as well as for large-scale predictions,
            then one can determine the closest analog in the pool according to the similarity of the large-scale variables.
            Sound familiar? In the exercise on the particle filter we have also selected the closest among model simulations.
            Similarly as in that exercise, all that is needed is a distance measure.
            This distance is then evaluated for each case in the pool of analogs.
            The method is not only useful for forecasting, but also for weather reconstruction,
            given suitable large-scale predictors (e.g., from a reanalysis) and local information.

            In the <a href="data/Applications_Analog_Exercise.xls" target="_blank">attached sheet</a>
            you get one year worth of data (far too small a sample, but computationally doable) of
            local precipitation and three large-scale predictors. We also have these predictors
            for the preceding month. Use the “Best Analog” approach based on the Eucledian
            distance (variables are already standardized). You can use R or Excel
            (this gets tricky and requires you to calculate a distance matrix, hence the layout of the sheet).
            Check your result against the <a href="data/Applications_Analog_Solution.xls" target="_blank">solution</a>,
            which also has the actual measurements. How good would you rate your reconstruction?
