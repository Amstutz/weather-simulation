            Many errors may occur when doing measurements – or during the later processing.
            The instrument may not work well, the reading may be erroneous, there may by typos,
            or errors may occur during processing. Quality Control (QC) procedures are designed
            to find possible errors. A simple QC procedure is visual inspection. Plotting time series,
            their statistics, or scater plots of correlated variables helps finding suspect values.
            Automatic tests start in a first step search for physically impossible values
            (e.g., negative precipitation, humidity >100%, temperature < 0 K, pressure <0 hPa)
            or physically unplausible values (e.g., temperatures outside -80 and +60 °C,
            pressure outside 500 to 1100 hPa). A third set of tests often makes use of the
            full length of a series. For instance, values that exceed ±4 standard deviations
            are flagged for further inspection. Also the sequence is analysed: Often temperature
            (pressure) observations on consecutive days that differ by more or 25 °C (40 hPa)
            are flagged, as are four or more equal consecutive values in a row. Further tests
            address the physical consistency between two variables and the spatial
            consistency by comparing neighbouring stations.

        Use your solution to the previous exercise and search for suspect temperature and
        pressure values using the first three steps and by simple plotting.
