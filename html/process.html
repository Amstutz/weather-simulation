            From the raw instrument readings it is a long way to hazard maps.
            Observations in earlier times were sometimes made in units that are different from todayâ€™s.
            In addition, some of the raw measurements need to be processed in order to make them comparable.
            This is the case, for instance, for pressure when measured with a mercury barometer in the units of a length.
            Eventually we want to compare the atmospheric pressure at several stations (independent of their altitude, i.e.,
            reduced to mean sea level) in order to draw high and low pressure systems. To convert the length of the mercury
            column in the barometer in mm to mean sea-level pressure in hPa we need four steps: Adjustment to standard
            temperature, conversion to pressure units, correction for local gravity, and reduction to mean sea level.

        gives the raw digitized pressure and temperature values for the station of St. Gallen, Switzerland,
        from 1813-1816, along with some auxiliary information. Convert the raw pressure readings to mean sea level (in hPa).
