            Station data series are important and for some applications sufficient.
            Other applications need the full state of the atmosphere.
            Techniques of data assimilation provide best estimates of the atmospheric state
            given the (sparse) information about the real atmosphere at a given time and
            given all we know about the physics of the atmosphere. The latter comes in
            the form of a numerical weather prediction model. Data assimilation has become a
            powerful tool in atmospheric science and the products generated in this way have
            become the most widely used data sets in geosciences, including climate and weather applications.

            In the following, we introduce and practice key concepts of data assimilation
            using the example from the video – the inclined throw.
            The <span class="text-danger">exercises</span> will guide you through different approaches of data assimilation.

        a) Score a goal (model: Schiefer Wurf), learning outcome: Understand that the model provides physical consistency, but not reality.
        (danach Beobachtungen einblenden)
    </p>
    <p>
        b) Particle Filter: Perform 10 members, choose closest, 3 steps
        (if the 50 members can be downloaded as an ascii file, a solution script in R will also be given)
    </p>
    <p>
        c) Kalman Filter
        Two PDF Files provide an Introduction of the main concept [Reanalysis_DataAssimilation_Introduction.pdf] and of the Kalman Filter [Reanalysis_DataAssimilation_KalmanFilter.pdf].

        Exercise 1: You have a substance that decays radioactively.
        You can use the well known model: Nt+1 = Nt e–λ Δt, with λ = 0.5 s-1. In addition, you have observations of a Geiger counter (in counts/s).
        The error of the observation is 2 counts/s, the error of the model is a bit more
        complex as it is given in an error of the decay constant of 0.025 s-1 (the values per time step are already calculated for you).
        Open the Excel Sheet [Reanalysis_DataAssimilation_Exercise1.xls], do the assimilation over the first 20 s and compare with the solution [Reanalysis_DataAssimilation_Solution1.xls].
    </p>
    <p>
        Exercise 2: Let’s return to the football example. The model is that of the inclined throw used above, with a simple friction term. Have a look at the PDF [Reanalysis_DataAssimilation_Exercise.pdf] and download the Excel-sheet [Reanalysis_DataAssimilation_Exercise2.xls]. The first part of the solution is the algebraic formulation [Reanalysis_DataAssimilation_SolutionAlgebra.pdf]; the numeric solution is give nin the Excel sheet [Reanalysis_DataAssimilation_Solution2.xls].
