            Even after QC, meteorological series may reflect non-climatic influences.
            For instance, a replaced thermometer or the relocation of a wetaher screen
            may have led to an artificial step change in temperature. Such effects are called
            inhomogeneities, and the process of removing them is called homogenization.
            Statistically, step inhomogeneities are called break points. To detect break points,
            climatologists compare a candidate series with one or several reference series,
            which are highly correlated with the candidate series, such as series from
            neighbouring locations. The reference series is supposed to be homogeneous.
            By analysing only the differences, the real weather variability (common to both series)
            is suppressed, thus better exposing artificial affects.

            A simple way to find breaks in meteorological time series is the Craddock test.
            The basic principle is to accumulate the differences (for precipitation or wind ratios are used instead of differences).
            In a homogenous section of the series, the accumulated differences build a straight line.
            Breakpoints are recognizable subjectively as breaks or bends in the accumulated differences.
            Try it yourself in the <span class="text-danger">Exercises</span>.

        <p class="card-text">
            For the Craddock test the accumulated normalized differences s are calculated as follows:

            $$s_{i} = s_{i-1} + a_{i} + (b_{m} - a_{m}) - b_{i}$$
            where \(a\) is the reference series, \(b\) is the candidate series, \(a_{m}\)
            is the mean of the reference series over the whole period, \(a_{m}\) is
            the mean of the candidate series over the whole period.Open the
            <a href="data/ClimateData_Homogenize_BreakDetection_Exercise.xls" target="_blank">Excel-file</a>
            and calculate \(s_{i}\). Afterwards, find the breakpoints in the figure on the
            right in the Excel-sheet (check the <a href="data/ClimateData_Homogenize_BreakDetection_Solution.xls" target="_blank">solution</a>).

            If possible, detected breaks are corrected. Thereby the most recent part of the
            series is considered to be correct, and the earlier segements are corrected
            towards the recent segments, working backwards. The correction amount is the
            the difference between the mean value of the difference series before and after the
            break, and this correction amount is subtracted form the segement before the break
            (see <a href=http://campusvirtual.senamhi.gob.pe/climandes" target="_blank">Climandes</a> for further information).
            Open the <a href="data/ClimateData_Homogenize_BreakCorrection_Exercise.xls" target="_blank">Excel-file</a>
            and try to correct the breaks you have found in the previous exercise
            (hereâ€™s the <a href="data/ClimateData_Homogenize_BreakCorrection_Solution.xls" target="_blank">solution</a>).
