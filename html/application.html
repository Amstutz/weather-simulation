            We have gone a long way from historical climate data to weather products.
            We have seen how we can reconstruct the local weather using historical observations,
            numerical weather prediction models and statistics.
            We have also seen that errors can occur on all scales: Measurements can be wrong, QC and homogenization is needed.
            Reanalyses can generate realistic large scale fields, but need to be critically assessed.
            Downscaling methods can produce local information, but with uncertainties.
            Now comes the last step: the application.

            Long-term weather products can be used the generate hazard maps (e.g., using statistics),
            or they can be further processed with numerical models.
            Hydrological models can be used to simulated runoff given the precipitation.
            Hydraulic models can then be used to determine the flooded area given the runoff.
            Loss models can be used to map the storm risk, crop models can be used to simulate
            harvested biomass. Many applications in climate impact research are based on high
            resolution input data. These applications benefit from historical weather data.
            In the <span class="text-danger">exercise</span> you learn to build and use a simple model to calculate the lake level.

            In the catchment for which you have reconstructed precipitation, there is a lake.
            A company operates ferries and cruise ships on this lake. Navigation cannot take
            place if the lake level is below 5 m, and also not if it is above 8 m.
            The company would like to know on how many days per year the lake is not navigable.
            In the <a href="data/Applications_LakeModel_Exercise.xls" target="_blank">Excel sheet</a>
            you have precipitation data (downscaled or observed) since 1950, plus a starting value.
            Use a simple mass balance model to simulate the lake level day by day.

            $$L_{t} = L_{t-1} e^{ -\lambda \Delta t} + f R_{t}$$

            where \(L\) is the lake level (in mm), \(R\) is daily rain fall (in mm), \(f\) (= 10)
            is the concentration factor (ratio between the catchment area and the lake surface area),
            \(\lambda\) (= 0.004 per day) describes the outflow of the lake, \(\Delta t\) (= 1 day) is the time increment.
            Note that this is an oversimplified model that neglects evaporation,
            storage in the form of snow or any other hydrological processes (see <a href="data/Applications_LakeModel_Solution.xls" target="_blank">solution</a>).
